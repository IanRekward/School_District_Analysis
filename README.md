# School_District_Analysis

To whom it may concern,

I have received permission to submit this assignment late. 

This module and challenge have been exceptionally time-consuming and difficult for myself and a number of my peers.
I have put a tremendous effort into getting this all wrapped up, and unfortunately, It hasn’t been enough.  I am 
loathe to turn in incomplete work, but I can’t afford to expend more temporal or mental capital on this project. 
I have organized and participated in multiple study/working sessions for this project alone, so I am utilizing my 
resources and time as efficiently as possible. 

I am taking good notes, and I’m absorbing the Python content well. So, I’ll consider this a growing pain and 
keep moving forward. 

Respectfully yours, 
Ian Rekward
